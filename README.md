# SingleCell10x.jl

A Julia package for loading 10x Single Cell RNA-seq and antibody count data.

It supports loading of 10x ".h5" files as well as text-based ".mtx" and ".tsv/.csv" files.
The count matrix can be transposed at load time and the data types of the matrix and annotations can be chosen conveniently.

More information on the file formats can be found in the [10x Genomics offical documentation](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/output/overview).
Note that this is an independent implementation - any bugs you find should be reported here, not to 10x Genomics.


## Documentation
The package should hopefully be straightforward to use.
See below for example usage. More detailed descriptions are in the docstrings of the exported functions:

* `read10x`
* `read10x_matrix`
* `read10x_features`
* `read10x_barcodes`


## Example usage
Below, we will load files from the `test/` directory, but you can try with your own files instead.
```julia
basepath = joinpath(pkgdir(SingleCell10x),"test/data/500_PBMC_3p_LT_Chromium_X_50genes/")
```


### Basic loading
Loading a sparse count matrix, feature annotations and barcode annotations from a ".h5" file:
```julia
using SingleCell10x
filepath = joinpath(basepath, "filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5")

matrix,features,barcodes = read10x(filepath)
```

You can also load the matrix/features/barcodes separately:
```julia
matrix2 = read10x_matrix(filepath)
features2 = read10x_features(filepath)
barcodes2 = read10x_barcodes(filepath)
```


### Sink types
Per default, the matrix will be a `SparseMatrixCSC{Int,Int}`, features will be a `NamedTuple` where keys are column names and elements are column vectors, and barcodes a `Vector{String}`.
But you can also specify sink types to load directly into the desired type:
```julia
using DataFrames
matrix,features,barcodes = read10x(filepath, Matrix{Float64}, DataFrame, DataFrame)
```
or similarly
```julia
matrix2 = read10x_matrix(filepath, Matrix{Float64})
features2 = read10x_features(filepath, DataFrame)
barcodes2 = read10x_barcodes(filepath, DataFrame)
```


### MatrixMarket .mtx files
Instead of loading a ".h5", `SingleCell10x.jl` also support the text-based "matrix.mtx(.gz)" with companion files. By default, feature/barcode filenames are searched for in the same folder.
```julia
filepath_mtx = joinpath(basepath,"filtered_feature_bc_matrix/matrix.mtx.gz")

matrix,features,barcodes = read10x(filepath_mtx)
```

If you load features/barcodes separately, you can either specify the path to the "matrix.mtx(.gz)" file or the feature/barcode file directly.

```julia
filepath_features = joinpath(basepath,"filtered_feature_bc_matrix/features.tsv.gz")
filepath_barcodes = joinpath(basepath,"filtered_feature_bc_matrix/barcodes.tsv.gz")

features2 = read10x_features(filepath_mtx)
features3 = read10x_features(filepath_features)

barcodes2 = read10x_barcodes(filepath_mtx)
barcodes3 = read10x_barcodes(filepath_barcodes)
```
